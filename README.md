# WebStoor

WebStoor is a practice project made by me, to practice full-stack application development.

The project will be consist of the following components:
* Go(lang) backend, with Gin framework
* TypeScript frontend, with React
* MongoDB as database

Planned features include:
* Webstore with basic functionality,
* Administration panel 
* Analytics dashboard.

And the following might be included:
* Data generation ("fake" purchases and reviews from admin panel)
* Machine learning for the analytics dashboard (NLP for review sentiment, model development in Python and deployment in Go)
